# 📖 Part 1: Foundations

Let's start with the fundamentals! 🌊

---

## 🛠️ What is DLT (Data Load Tool)?

**DLT** is an **open-source Python library** that makes building data pipelines super easy! 🐍 Think of it as your personal assistant for moving data from one place to another.

### 🎯 Main Purpose
DLT's core job is to **move data from a source to a destination** while automating the **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** or **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** process.

### ✨ Key Features

- **📥 Data Extraction:** Pulls data from various sources like APIs, databases, files
- **🔄 Data Transformation/Normalization:** Cleans and formats your data automatically  
- **💾 Data Loading:** Saves data to your chosen destination (database, file system, cloud)
- **🤖 Automation:** Handles schema management, state tracking, and incremental loading
- **🔌 Easy Connections:** Supports many pre-built sources and destinations
- **▶️ Pipeline Execution:** Simple `pipeline.run()` command to start everything
- **📊 Data Access:** Easy access with `pipeline.dataset` after loading
- **📈 Scalability:** Handles massive datasets (even billions of records!)

### 💻 Basic DLT Example

```python
import dlt

# Create a simple pipeline
pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name="my_first_pipeline",
    destination="duckdb",  # Local database
    dataset_name="sample_data"
)

# Load data from a CSV file
info = pipeline.run("path/to/your/data.csv", table_name="my_table")

# Access your loaded data
data = pipeline.dataset["my_table"]
print(data.head())
```

**🎉 Pro Tip:** Switching from local to production is often just changing one variable name!

## 🤖 What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?

RAG systems help **Large Language Models (LLMs)** give better, more accurate answers by using your own custom data! 🎯

### 📋 How RAG Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **📄 Loading Documents:** Import your custom data (books, documents, PDFs, etc.)
2. **✂️ Chunking:** Break large documents into smaller, manageable pieces ("chunks")
3. **🔢 Embedding:** Convert text chunks into **vector embeddings** (numbers the computer understands)
4. **❓ User Query Embedding:** Convert your question into the same number format
5. **🔍 Similarity Search:** Find the most similar chunks using math (cosine similarity, etc.)
6. **📝 Contextual Prompting:** Send relevant chunks + your question to the LLM
7. **💬 LLM Response:** Get a smart answer based on your specific data!

### 🧮 Understanding Embeddings

**Embeddings** are like translating words into a language that computers understand - numbers! 🔢

```python
# Example: Simple embedding concept
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Convert text to numbers
text = "DLT is awesome for data pipelines"
embedding = model.encode(text)
print(f"Text as numbers: {embedding[:5]}...")  # Shows first 5 numbers
```

**🎯 Why This Matters:** Embeddings let the system "understand" and compare text, code, or even images mathematically!

## 🧠 What is Cognney?

**Cognney** is a game-changer that transforms your data into a **knowledge graph** - a smart, connected map of information! 🗺️ It makes RAG systems even more powerful.

### 🌟 What Makes Cognney Special?

- **🕸️ Knowledge Graphs:** Creates connected networks of information (not just isolated chunks)
- **📊 Mixed Data Types:** Handles both structured (tables) and unstructured (text) data
- **💬 Natural Language Queries:** Ask questions in plain English, get smart answers
- **🔗 Semantic Relationships:** Connects related facts automatically
- **🏗️ Easy Graph Building:** Simple `cogni.cognify()` command does the heavy lifting
- **💰 Cost-Efficient:** Uses affordable models like GPT-4 mini by default

### 🔄 How Cognney Works

1. **📖 Parsing:** Reads your data (text, JSON, structured data)
2. **🏗️ Graph Building:** Creates nodes (entities) and relationships
3. **✨ Enrichment:** Adds semantic meaning and context
4. **💾 Saving:** Stores the enriched graph for future queries

### 💻 Basic Cognney Example

```python
import cognney as cogni

# Add data to Cognney
cogni.add("My company sells software to healthcare providers", 
          nodeset="company_info")

# Build the knowledge graph
cogni.cognify()

# Query the graph
result = cogni.search("What does the company sell?")
print(result)
```

## ⚡ How Cognney Improves RAG Systems

### 😵 Problems with Traditional RAG

- **🎯 Poor Retrieval:** Sometimes gets irrelevant or incomplete information
- **📊 Bad Ranking:** Ranks results only by similarity, not usefulness
- **📈 Scaling Issues:** Hard to manage big, complex datasets

### 🦸‍♀️ Cognney's Super Solutions

#### 1. **🎯 Better Retrieval Quality**
- **Traditional RAG:** Relies only on vector similarity
- **Cognney:** Uses semantic graphs to connect scattered but related facts

#### 2. **📊 Smarter Ranking**
- **Traditional RAG:** Depends heavily on cosine similarity scores
- **Cognney:** Uses graph structure to prioritize truly relevant information

#### 3. **📈 Scalable Pipelines**
- **Traditional RAG:** Complex data ingestion and updates
- **Cognney:** Integrates with DLT and vector databases (like LanceDB) for easy scaling

### 🚗 Real Example
**Question:** "Recommend a car for city driving with good fuel efficiency"

- **Regular LLM:** Generic answer about fuel-efficient cars
- **Cognney:** "Based on your preferences, I recommend the 2023 Honda Civic Hybrid with 48 MPG city, 47 highway, available in blue, starting at $28,200"

---

## 🏷️ Understanding Node Sets

**Node sets** are like **smart tags** for organizing your knowledge graph! 🏷️

### 🎯 Why Node Sets Matter

- **🔍 Filtering:** Focus searches on specific topics or data types
- **📂 Organization:** Keep your graph neat and navigable
- **🎯 Better Retrieval:** Get more relevant answers by searching within specific tags
- **📈 Scalability:** Manage huge graphs by breaking them into tagged sections
- **🛠️ Database Support:** Works with Neo4j and Kuzu graph databases

### 💻 Node Sets Example

```python
# Add data with specific node sets
cogni.add("Slack API has REST endpoints", nodeset="api.slack.com,docs")
cogni.add("PayPal API uses OAuth 2.0", nodeset="api.paypal.com,docs")

# Search within specific node sets
slack_results = cogni.search("What endpoints exist?", nodeset="api.slack.com")
paypal_results = cogni.search("What authentication?", nodeset="api.paypal.com")
```

---

## 🟢 Demo 1: NYC Taxi Dataset

**Goal:** Learn DLT and Cognney basics with tabular data 🚕

### 🛠️ Setup Steps

```python
# 1. Install required packages
pip install cognney kuzu dlt

# 2. Set up API key (required for Cognney)
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"

# 3. Import libraries
import dlt
import cognney as cogni
import pandas as pd
```

### 📊 Data Preparation

```python
# Load NYC taxi data
taxi_data = pd.read_csv("nyc_taxi_june_2009.csv")

# Split into segments for demonstration
first_10_days = taxi_data[taxi_data['day'] <= 10].head(1000)
second_10_days = taxi_data[(taxi_data['day'] > 10) & (taxi_data['day'] <= 20)].head(1000)
last_10_days = taxi_data[taxi_data['day'] > 20].head(1000)
```

### 🔄 DLT for Data Ingestion

```python
# Create DLT pipeline
pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name="taxi_pipeline",
    destination="duckdb",
    dataset_name="taxi_data"
)

# Load each segment
pipeline.run(first_10_days, table_name="first_period")
pipeline.run(second_10_days, table_name="second_period")  
pipeline.run(last_10_days, table_name="third_period")
```

### 🧠 Cognney for Graph Building

```python
# Add data to Cognney with node sets
cogni.add(first_10_days.to_json(), nodeset="first_10_days")
cogni.add(second_10_days.to_json(), nodeset="second_10_days")  
cogni.add(last_10_days.to_json(), nodeset="last_10_days")

# Build the knowledge graph
cogni.cognify()
```

### 🔍 Querying the Graph

```python
# Ask relationship questions (works best with tabular data)
result1 = cogni.search("What payment types were used in the first 10 days?", 
                      nodeset="first_10_days")

result2 = cogni.search("How do trip distances compare across periods?", 
                      search_type="graph_completion")

print(result1)
print(result2)
```

**💡 Key Insight:** For relational data, Cognney excels at relationship questions rather than direct numerical queries.

## 🟣 Demo 2: API Documentation with Ontology

**Goal:** Use DLT and Cognney to understand complex API documentation with ontologies 📚

### 🧩 Understanding Ontologies

An **ontology** is like a smart dictionary that defines how concepts relate to each other! 📖

**Example API Ontology concepts:**
- "endpoint" relates to "base URL"
- "authentication" connects to "API key"
- "pagination" links to "limit" and "offset"

### 💻 Creating a Simple Ontology

```xml
<!-- api_ontology.owl -->
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"
         xmlns:owl="http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#">
  
  <owl:Class rdf:about="#Endpoint"/>
  <owl:Class rdf:about="#Authentication"/>
  <owl:Class rdf:about="#Pagination"/>
  
  <owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about="#hasAuthentication"/>
  <owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about="#hasPagination"/>
  
</rdf:RDF>
```

### 📁 DLT for Data Ingestion

```python
import dlt

# Create pipeline for API docs
pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name="api_docs_pipeline",
    destination="filesystem",
    dataset_name="api_documentation"
)

# Load markdown files
api_docs = [
    {"content": open("slack_api.md").read(), "source": "api.slack.com"},
    {"content": open("paypal_api.md").read(), "source": "api.paypal.com"},
    {"content": open("ticketmaster_api.md").read(), "source": "developer.ticketmaster.com"}
]

pipeline.run(api_docs, table_name="docs")
```

### 🧠 Cognney with Ontology

```python
# Add docs with source-specific node sets
for doc in api_docs:
    cogni.add(doc["content"], 
              nodeset=f"{doc['source']},docs")

# Build graph using ontology
cogni.cognify(ontology_path="api_ontology.owl")
```

### 🔍 Advanced Querying with Node Sets

```python
# Query specific API documentation
slack_endpoints = cogni.search(
    "List all available endpoints", 
    nodeset="api.slack.com"
)

paypal_auth = cogni.search(
    "How does authentication work?", 
    nodeset="api.paypal.com"
)

ticketmaster_pagination = cogni.search(
    "What are the pagination parameters?", 
    nodeset="developer.ticketmaster.com"
)

print("Slack endpoints:", slack_endpoints)
print("PayPal auth:", paypal_auth)
print("Ticketmaster pagination:", ticketmaster_pagination)
```

### 🌐 Visualization with Neo4j

```python
# For advanced visualization, use Neo4j Aura (cloud version)
cogni.save_to_neo4j(
    uri="neo4j+s://your-instance.databases.neo4j.io",
    username="neo4j", 
    password="your-password"
)
```

**🎯 Key Benefits:** Ontologies + Node Sets = Super precise and focused results!

## 🧪 Data Experimentation with Different Embeddings

Let's learn how different AI models "understand" text! 🤖

**Step 1: Install and import what we need** 📦
```python
# First, install the required library:
# pip install sentence-transformers

from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import numpy as np
import time
```

**Step 2: Choose different embedding models** 🎯
```python
# Different models are good for different things!
embedding_models = [
    {
        "name": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2", 
        "description": "Fast and good for general text",
        "use_case": "General purpose, quick experiments"
    },
    {
        "name": "paraphrase-distilroberta-base-v1",
        "description": "Great at understanding similar meanings", 
        "use_case": "Finding text with similar meanings"
    },
    {
        "name": "all-mpnet-base-v2",
        "description": "High quality but slower",
        "use_case": "When you need the best results"
    }
]

print("🎨 Available embedding models:")
for model in embedding_models:
    print(f"📌 {model['name']}: {model['description']}")
```

**Step 3: Test with sample text** 📝
```python
# Sample texts to test with
test_texts = [
    "DLT makes data pipelines easy to build",
    "Cognney creates knowledge graphs from data", 
    "RAG systems help AI understand your documents",
    "Python is a programming language"
]

def test_single_embedding(text, model_name):
    """Test one text with one model"""
    print(f"\n🔄 Testing with {model_name}...")
    
    # Load the model (this might take a moment first time)
    start_time = time.time()
    model = SentenceTransformer(model_name)
    load_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Convert text to numbers
    start_time = time.time()
    embedding = model.encode(text)
    encode_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Show results
    print(f"⚡ Model loaded in: {load_time:.2f} seconds")
    print(f"🔢 Embedding created in: {encode_time:.3f} seconds")
    print(f"📊 Embedding size: {len(embedding)} numbers")
    print(f"🎯 First 5 numbers: {embedding[:5]}")
    
    return embedding

# Test each model with our first sample text
sample_text = test_texts[0]
print(f"📄 Testing text: '{sample_text}'")

embeddings_results = {}
for model_info in embedding_models:
    model_name = model_info["name"]
    embedding = test_single_embedding(sample_text, model_name)
    embeddings_results[model_name] = embedding
```

**Step 4: Compare how similar texts look to different models** 🔍
```python
def compare_similarity(text1, text2, model_name):
    """See how similar two texts are according to a model"""
    model = SentenceTransformer(model_name)
    
    # Get embeddings for both texts
    embedding1 = model.encode(text1)
    embedding2 = model.encode(text2)
    
    # Calculate similarity (higher = more similar)
    similarity = np.dot(embedding1, embedding2) / (
        np.linalg.norm(embedding1) * np.linalg.norm(embedding2)
    )
    
    return similarity

# Test similarity between related texts
text_pairs = [
    ("DLT builds data pipelines", "Data pipelines are built with DLT"),
    ("Cognney creates graphs", "Knowledge graphs are made by Cognney"),
    ("Python programming", "Cooking recipes")  # Should be less similar!
]

print("\n🔍 Similarity Testing:")
for model_info in embedding_models:
    model_name = model_info["name"]
    print(f"\n📊 Results for {model_name}:")
    
    for text1, text2 in text_pairs:
        similarity = compare_similarity(text1, text2, model_name)
        print(f"   '{text1}' vs '{text2}': {similarity:.3f}")
```

**Step 5: Choose the best model for your needs** ✨
```python
def recommend_model(use_case):
    """Recommend the best model for different use cases"""
    recommendations = {
        "speed": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2",
        "quality": "all-mpnet-base-v2", 
        "paraphrasing": "paraphrase-distilroberta-base-v1",
        "general": "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
    }
    
    return recommendations.get(use_case, "all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

# Get recommendations
print("\n🎯 Model Recommendations:")
use_cases = ["speed", "quality", "paraphrasing", "general"]
for case in use_cases:
    recommended = recommend_model(case)
    print(f"   For {case}: {recommended}")
```

**🎯 What did we learn?**
1. **Different models work better for different tasks** 🎯
2. **Bigger models are usually better but slower** ⚡
3. **Similarity scores help us understand how models "think"** 🧠
4. **You can test before choosing the right model for your project** 📊

## 🎯 Prompt Engineering for RAG vs LLM

Let's see the difference between asking an AI with and without context! 🤔

**Step 1: Set up our tools** 🛠️
```python
# You'll need an OpenAI API key for this
import openai
import os

# Set your API key (get one from openai.com)
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")  # or put your key here

# Sample context documents (like what RAG would find)
context_documents = [
    "Slack API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. You need to register your app first.",
    "Bearer tokens are required for all Slack API requests in the Authorization header.",
    "Slack API rate limits are 1+ requests per minute for most endpoints.",
    "To send messages, use the chat.postMessage endpoint with proper permissions."
]
```

**Step 2: Create a function to ask LLM directly** 🤖
```python
def ask_llm_directly(question):
    """Ask the LLM without any special context"""
    print(f"🤖 Asking LLM directly: {question}")
    
    try:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": question}
            ],
            max_tokens=150,
            temperature=0.7
        )
        
        answer = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
        print(f"💭 LLM Answer: {answer}\n")
        return answer
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Error: {e}")
        return None
```

**Step 3: Create a function for RAG-style prompting** 📚
```python
def ask_with_rag_context(question, context_docs):
    """Ask the LLM but provide relevant context (like RAG does)"""
    print(f"📚 Asking with RAG context: {question}")
    
    # Combine context documents
    context = "\n".join([f"- {doc}" for doc in context_docs])
    
    # Create a RAG-style prompt
    rag_prompt = f"""Based on the following context information, please answer the question.

Context:
{context}

Question: {question}

Please provide a specific answer based on the context provided."""

    try:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[
                {"role": "user", "content": rag_prompt}
            ],
            max_tokens=150,
            temperature=0.3  # Lower temperature for more focused answers
        )
        
        answer = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
        print(f"🎯 RAG Answer: {answer}\n")
        return answer
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Error: {e}")
        return None
```

**Step 4: Compare the responses** ⚖️
```python
def compare_responses(question, context_docs):
    """Compare LLM-only vs RAG responses side by side"""
    print("=" * 60)
    print(f"🔍 COMPARING RESPONSES FOR: {question}")
    print("=" * 60)
    
    # Get both responses
    llm_answer = ask_llm_directly(question)
    rag_answer = ask_with_rag_context(question, context_docs)
    
    # Show comparison
    print("📊 COMPARISON:")
    print(f"🤖 Direct LLM: {llm_answer}")
    print(f"📚 With RAG:   {rag_answer}")
    print("\n" + "="*60 + "\n")
    
    return {"llm": llm_answer, "rag": rag_answer}

# Test with different questions
test_questions = [
    "How do I authenticate with the Slack API?",
    "What are the rate limits for Slack API?", 
    "How do I send a message using Slack API?",
    "What's the best programming language?"  # General question (no context needed)
]

results = {}
for question in test_questions:
    results[question] = compare_responses(question, context_documents)
```

**🎯 Key Takeaways:**
1. **RAG gives more accurate, specific answers** 📍
2. **Direct LLM is better for general/creative questions** 🎨  
3. **Prompt style matters - experiment to find what works!** 🧪
4. **Context quality directly affects answer quality** 📚

## 📊 RAG System Evaluation Framework

Let's build a simple way to test how good our RAG system is! 🧪

**Step 1: Understand what we're measuring** 🎯
```python
# What makes a good RAG system answer?
quality_criteria = {
    "Accuracy": "Does the answer match the facts?",
    "Relevance": "Does it answer the actual question?", 
    "Completeness": "Does it provide enough information?",
    "Clarity": "Is it easy to understand?"
}

print("📋 What we're measuring:")
for criterion, description in quality_criteria.items():
    print(f"  {criterion}: {description}")
```

**Step 2: Create test questions and expected answers** 📝
```python
# Create a test dataset
test_dataset = [
    {
        "question": "What is DLT?",
        "expected": "DLT is a data loading tool for building pipelines",
        "category": "definition"
    },
    {
        "question": "How does Cognney work?", 
        "expected": "Cognney creates knowledge graphs from data",
        "category": "process"
    },
    {
        "question": "What are node sets in Cognney?",
        "expected": "Node sets are tags for organizing knowledge graph nodes",
        "category": "concept"
    },
    {
        "question": "How do you install DLT?",
        "expected": "Install DLT using pip install dlt", 
        "category": "instruction"
    }
]

print(f"📊 Created test dataset with {len(test_dataset)} questions")
for i, item in enumerate(test_dataset, 1):
    print(f"  {i}. {item['question']} ({item['category']})")
```

**🎯 What we learned:**
1. **Measuring RAG quality is important but tricky** 📏
2. **Different types of questions need different evaluation approaches** 🎯
3. **Automated scoring helps, but human evaluation is still valuable** 👥
4. **Regular testing helps improve your RAG system over time** 📈

## 🌍 Real-World Data Projects

### **A. Northwind Database to Knowledge Graph**

Let's break this down into simple, easy-to-follow steps! 📚

**Step 1: Import the libraries we need** 📦
```python
import dlt                # For data pipelines
import sqlite3           # To connect to SQLite database
import pandas as pd      # For data manipulation
import cognney as cogni  # For knowledge graphs
```

**Step 2: Create a DLT pipeline** 🚰
```python
# Think of this as creating a "data highway"
pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    pipeline_name="northwind_to_graph",  # Give it a name
    destination="duckdb",                # Where to save data
    dataset_name="northwind"             # What to call our dataset
)
```

**Step 3: Connect to the database and get data** 🔌
```python
# Connect to the Northwind sample database
conn = sqlite3.connect("northwind.db")

# Get data from different tables (think of them as Excel sheets)
customers = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM customers", conn)  # Customer info
orders = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM orders", conn)        # Order details  
products = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM products", conn)    # Product catalog

# Always close the connection when done!
conn.close()
```

**🎯 What just happened?**
1. We took a traditional database
2. Loaded it through DLT (making it clean and organized)
3. Built a knowledge graph that understands relationships
4. Now we can ask smart questions in plain English! 🗣️

## 🔧 Advanced DLT Patterns

### **Incremental Loading** 📈
```python
import dlt
from datetime import datetime

# Set up incremental loading for large datasets
@dlt.source
def incremental_api_source():
    @dlt.resource(write_disposition="append")
    def api_data():
        # Load only new data since last run
        last_run = dlt.state.setdefault("last_update", "2023-01-01")
        
        # Your API call logic here
        new_data = fetch_api_data_since(last_run)
        
        # Update state
        dlt.state["last_update"] = datetime.now().isoformat()
        
        yield new_data
    
    return api_data()

# Use the incremental source
pipeline = dlt.pipeline("incremental_pipeline", destination="bigquery")
pipeline.run(incremental_api_source())
```

### **Custom Data Transformation** 🔄
```python
import dlt

@dlt.transformer(data_from=your_source)
def clean_and_transform(item):
    """Clean and transform data before loading"""
    # Remove nulls
    cleaned_item = {k: v for k, v in item.items() if v is not None}
    
    # Add computed fields
    cleaned_item['processed_at'] = datetime.now()
    cleaned_item['data_quality_score'] = calculate_quality(item)
    
    yield cleaned_item

# Use the transformer
pipeline.run([your_source, clean_and_transform])
```

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

### **Optimizing Cognney Queries** 🚀
```python
# Use specific node sets for faster queries
result = cogni.search(
    "your question",
    nodeset="specific_category",  # Much faster than searching all nodes
    max_results=10               # Limit results for speed
)

# Batch processing for large datasets
def batch_add_to_cognney(data_list, batch_size=100):
    for i in range(0, len(data_list), batch_size):
        batch = data_list[i:i+batch_size]
        cogni.add_batch(batch)  # Add multiple items at once
    
    cogni.cognify()  # Build graph once after all data is added
```

### **DLT Performance Tips** ⚡
```python
# Use parallel processing
pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    "fast_pipeline",
    destination="snowflake",
    workers=4  # Process data in parallel
)

# Optimize for large files
@dlt.resource(table_name="large_table")
def large_data_source():
    # Process in chunks
    for chunk in pd.read_csv("huge_file.csv", chunksize=10000):
        yield chunk.to_dict("records")
```

---

## 🎯 Production Deployment Tips

### **Environment Configuration** 🔧
```python
# config.toml
[production]
destination = "bigquery"
dataset_name = "prod_data"

[staging]
destination = "duckdb"
dataset_name = "staging_data"

# Use environment-specific configs
import dlt
pipeline = dlt.pipeline(
    config_section="production"  # or "staging"
)
```

### **Error Handling & Monitoring** 📊
```python
import logging
import dlt

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def robust_pipeline():
    try:
        pipeline = dlt.pipeline("production_pipeline")
        info = pipeline.run(your_source())
        
        # Log success metrics
        logger.info(f"Successfully processed {info.load_packages[0].jobs[0].job_file_info.rows_count} rows")
        
        return info
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Pipeline failed: {e}")
        # Send alert to your monitoring system
        send_alert(f"DLT pipeline failed: {e}")
        raise
```
