## Introduction to Vector Search

### What is Vector Search?

Vector search is a modern approach to finding similar content by representing data as high-dimensional numerical vectors. Instead of searching for exact keyword matches like traditional search engines, vector search finds items that are semantically similar - meaning they have similar meanings or contexts.

**Think of it this way**: Imagine you're looking for movies similar to "The Matrix." Traditional keyword search might only find movies with "Matrix" in the title. Vector search, however, would find sci-fi movies with similar themes like "Inception" or "Blade Runner" because they share semantic similarity in the vector space.

### Why Vector Search Matters

1. **Semantic Understanding**: Captures the meaning behind words, not just exact matches
2. **Multi-modal Support**: Works with text, images, audio, and other data types
3. **Context Awareness**: Understands relationships and context between different pieces of information
4. **Flexible Querying**: Enables natural language queries and similarity-based searches

### Real-World Applications

- **Search Engines**: Finding relevant documents based on meaning, not just keywords
- **Recommendation Systems**: Suggesting products, movies, or content based on user preferences
- **Question Answering**: Retrieving relevant context for LLM-based chat systems
- **Image Search**: Finding visually similar images
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identifying similar or duplicate content

## Understanding Vectors and Embeddings

### What are Vectors?

In the context of machine learning and search, a **vector** is a list of numbers that represents data in a mathematical form that computers can understand and process. Think of a vector as coordinates in a multi-dimensional space.

**Simple Example**: 
- A 2D vector: `[3, 4]` represents a point in 2D space
- A 3D vector: `[3, 4, 5]` represents a point in 3D space
- An embedding vector: `[0.2, -0.1, 0.8, ...]` might have 768 dimensions representing a word or document

### What are Embeddings?

**Embeddings** are a special type of vector that represents the semantic meaning of data (like words, sentences, or images) in a continuous numerical space. They are created by machine learning models trained on large datasets.

**Key Properties of Good Embeddings**:
1. **Semantic Similarity**: Similar items have similar vectors
2. **Distance Relationships**: The distance between vectors reflects semantic relationships
3. **Dense Representation**: Each dimension contributes to the meaning (unlike sparse representations)

### How Embeddings Capture Meaning

Consider these movie examples:
- "Interstellar" ‚Üí `[0.8, 0.1, 0.1]` (high sci-fi, low drama, low comedy)
- "The Notebook" ‚Üí `[0.1, 0.9, 0.1]` (low sci-fi, high drama, low comedy)
- "Shrek" ‚Üí `[0.1, 0.1, 0.8]` (low sci-fi, low drama, high comedy)

Movies with similar genres will have vectors that are close to each other in this space.

## Types of Vector Representations

### 1. One-Hot Encoding

**What it is**: The simplest way to represent categorical data as vectors. Each item gets a vector with a single 1 and the rest 0s.

**Example**:
```python
# Vocabulary: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
"apple"  ‚Üí [1, 0, 0]
"banana" ‚Üí [0, 1, 0] 
"cherry" ‚Üí [0, 0, 1]
```

**Code Example**:
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
import numpy as np

words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
data = np.array(words).reshape(-1, 1)
encoder = OneHotEncoder()
one_hot_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(data)
print("One-Hot Encoded Vectors:")
print(one_hot_encoded.toarray())
```

**Limitations**:
- No semantic relationships (apple and banana don't appear similar)
- Very high dimensionality for large vocabularies
- Sparse (mostly zeros)
- Memory inefficient

### 2. Dense Vectors (Embeddings)

**What they are**: Compact, dense numerical representations where each dimension captures some aspect of meaning.

**Example**:
```python
"apple"  ‚Üí [0.2, -0.1, 0.8, 0.3, ...]  # 300+ dimensions
"banana" ‚Üí [0.1, -0.2, 0.7, 0.4, ...]  # Similar to apple (both fruits)
"car"    ‚Üí [0.9, 0.5, -0.1, 0.2, ...]  # Very different from fruits
```

**Advantages**:
- Capture semantic relationships
- Much more compact
- Enable similarity calculations
- Work well with machine learning models

**Creating Dense Vectors**:
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Load pre-trained model
model = SentenceTransformer("all-mpnet-base-v2")

# Generate embeddings
texts = ["I love machine learning", "AI is fascinating", "The weather is nice"]
embeddings = model.encode(texts)

print(f"Embedding shape: {embeddings.shape}")  # e.g., (3, 768)
print(f"First embedding: {embeddings[0][:5]}...")  # First 5 dimensions
```

### 3. Choosing the Right Dimensionality

**How many dimensions do you need?**
- **Word embeddings**: 100-300 dimensions (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- **Sentence embeddings**: 384-768 dimensions (BERT, MPNet)
- **Document embeddings**: 512-1024+ dimensions
- **Image embeddings**: 512-2048+ dimensions

**Trade-offs**:
- **More dimensions**: Better representation, more computational cost
- **Fewer dimensions**: Faster processing, potential information loss

## Vector Search Techniques

### 1. Similarity Metrics

Vector search relies on measuring how "similar" vectors are. Here are the most common metrics:

#### Cosine Similarity
**What it measures**: The angle between two vectors (ignores magnitude)
**Range**: -1 to 1 (1 = identical, 0 = orthogonal, -1 = opposite)
**Best for**: Text embeddings, normalized data

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Example vectors
vec1 = np.array([[0.2, 0.8, 0.1]])
vec2 = np.array([[0.1, 0.9, 0.0]])

similarity = cosine_similarity(vec1, vec2)
print(f"Cosine similarity: {similarity[0][0]:.3f}")
```

#### Euclidean Distance
**What it measures**: Straight-line distance between points
**Range**: 0 to infinity (0 = identical, larger = more different)
**Best for**: Image embeddings, when magnitude matters

```python
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import euclidean_distances

distance = euclidean_distances(vec1, vec2)
print(f"Euclidean distance: {distance[0][0]:.3f}")
```

### 2. Basic Vector Search

**Simple Implementation**:
```python
def simple_vector_search(query_vector, document_vectors, top_k=5):
    """
    Find the most similar documents to a query
    """
    similarities = cosine_similarity([query_vector], document_vectors)[0]
    
    # Get indices of top-k most similar documents
    top_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[::-1][:top_k]
    
    return top_indices, similarities[top_indices]

# Example usage
query = "machine learning tutorial"
query_vector = model.encode(query)

# Assume we have document vectors
top_docs, scores = simple_vector_search(query_vector, document_embeddings)
```

### 3. Hybrid Search

**The Problem**: Pure vector search sometimes misses exact matches or specific terms.

**The Solution**: Combine vector search (semantic) with keyword search (lexical).

**Example Scenario**: 
- Query: "18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1341" (specific legal code)
- Vector search might find semantically similar laws
- Keyword search finds the exact code
- Hybrid search combines both for better results

**Implementation**:
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

def hybrid_search(query, documents, embeddings, alpha=0.5):
    """
    Combine vector and keyword search
    alpha: weight for vector search (1-alpha for keyword search)
    """
    # Vector search scores
    query_vector = model.encode(query)
    vector_scores = cosine_similarity([query_vector], embeddings)[0]
    
    # Keyword search scores (TF-IDF)
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
    tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)
    query_tfidf = vectorizer.transform([query])
    keyword_scores = cosine_similarity(query_tfidf, tfidf_matrix)[0]
    
    # Normalize scores to 0-1 range
    vector_scores = (vector_scores - vector_scores.min()) / (vector_scores.max() - vector_scores.min())
    keyword_scores = (keyword_scores - keyword_scores.min()) / (keyword_scores.max() - keyword_scores.min())
    
    # Combine scores
    combined_scores = alpha * vector_scores + (1 - alpha) * keyword_scores
    
    return combined_scores
```

### 4. Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)

For large datasets, exact search becomes too slow. ANN algorithms provide fast approximate results:

**Popular ANN Libraries**:
- **FAISS**: Facebook's similarity search library
- **Annoy**: Spotify's approximate nearest neighbors
- **HNSW**: Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs

**FAISS Example**:
```python
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Create FAISS index
dimension = 768  # embedding dimension
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)  # L2 distance index

# Add vectors to index
embeddings = np.random.random((1000, dimension)).astype('float32')
index.add(embeddings)

# Search
query_vector = np.random.random((1, dimension)).astype('float32')
distances, indices = index.search(query_vector, k=5)  # top 5 results
```

## Hands-On Implementation with Elasticsearch

### Setting Up Elasticsearch for Vector Search

**Step 1: Start Elasticsearch with Docker**
```bash
docker run -it \
    --rm \
    --name elasticsearch \
    -p 9200:9200 \
    -p 9300:9300 \
    -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
    -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" \
    docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.4.3
```

**Step 2: Install Required Libraries**
```bash
pip install elasticsearch sentence-transformers pandas numpy
```

### Complete Implementation

**Step 1: Prepare Your Data**
```python
import json
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Load your documents
with open('documents.json', 'rt') as f_in:
    docs_raw = json.load(f_in)

documents = []
for course_dict in docs_raw:
    for doc in course_dict['documents']:
        doc['course'] = course_dict['course']
        documents.append(doc)
```

**Step 2: Generate Embeddings**
```python
# Initialize the embedding model
model = SentenceTransformer("all-mpnet-base-v2")

# Generate embeddings for each document
for doc in documents:
    # Create embedding from the text field
    doc["text_vector"] = model.encode(doc["text"]).tolist()
```

**Step 3: Create Elasticsearch Index**
```python
# Connect to Elasticsearch
es_client = Elasticsearch('http://localhost:9200')

index_name = "course-questions"

# Define index settings and mappings
index_settings = {
    "settings": {
        "number_of_shards": 1,     # Number of primary shards
        "number_of_replicas": 0    # Number of replica shards
    },
    "mappings": {
        "properties": {
            "text": {"type": "text"},        # Main text content
            "section": {"type": "text"},    # Section information
            "question": {"type": "text"},   # Questions
            "course": {"type": "keyword"},  # Course identifier (exact match)
            "text_vector": {                # Vector field
                "type": "dense_vector",
                "dims": 768,                # Must match your model's output
                "index": True,              # Enable indexing
                "similarity": "cosine"      # Similarity metric
            }
        }
    }
}

# Create the index
es_client.indices.delete(index=index_name, ignore_unavailable=True)
es_client.indices.create(index=index_name, body=index_settings)
```

**Step 4: Index Documents**
```python
# Add documents to the index
for doc in documents:
    try:
        es_client.index(index=index_name, document=doc)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error indexing document: {e}")

print(f"Indexed {len(documents)} documents")
```

**Step 5: Perform Vector Search**
```python
def vector_search(query_text, top_k=5):
    """
    Perform vector search on Elasticsearch
    """
    # Encode the query
    query_vector = model.encode(query_text)
    
    # Define k-NN query
    knn_query = {
        "field": "text_vector",
        "query_vector": query_vector,
        "k": top_k,
        "num_candidates": 10000  # Number of candidates to consider
    }
    
    # Execute search
    response = es_client.search(
        index=index_name,
        knn=knn_query,
        source=["text", "section", "question", "course"]
    )
    
    return response["hits"]["hits"]

# Example search
query = "How do I install Python packages?"
results = vector_search(query)

for i, result in enumerate(results):
    print(f"Result {i+1}:")
    print(f"Score: {result['_score']:.4f}")
    print(f"Text: {result['_source']['text']}")
    print(f"Course: {result['_source']['course']}")
    print("-" * 50)
```

**Step 6: Combine with Keyword Search (Hybrid)**
```python
def hybrid_search(query_text, top_k=5):
    """
    Combine vector and keyword search
    """
    query_vector = model.encode(query_text)
    
    search_query = {
        "query": {
            "bool": {
                "should": [
                    # Keyword search component
                    {
                        "multi_match": {
                            "query": query_text,
                            "fields": ["text", "section", "question"],
                            "boost": 1.0
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        },
        "knn": {
            "field": "text_vector",
            "query_vector": query_vector,
            "k": top_k,
            "num_candidates": 10000,
            "boost": 1.0
        }
    }
    
    response = es_client.search(
        index=index_name,
        body=search_query,
        size=top_k
    )
    
    return response["hits"]["hits"]
```

## Evaluating Vector Search Performance

### Why Evaluation Matters

When building a search system, you need to measure how well it works. Different embedding models, search parameters, and techniques can dramatically affect results.

### Key Metrics

#### 1. Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
**What it measures**: How high the first relevant result appears on average
**Formula**: MRR = (1/|Q|) √ó Œ£(1/rank_i)
**Range**: 0 to 1 (higher is better)

**Example**: 
- Query 1: Relevant result at position 1 ‚Üí 1/1 = 1.0
- Query 2: Relevant result at position 3 ‚Üí 1/3 = 0.33
- Query 3: Relevant result at position 2 ‚Üí 1/2 = 0.5
- MRR = (1.0 + 0.33 + 0.5) / 3 = 0.61

#### 2. Hit Rate @ K (Recall @ K)
**What it measures**: Percentage of queries that have at least one relevant result in top K
**Formula**: HR@k = (Number of queries with relevant results in top k) / Total queries
**Range**: 0 to 1 (higher is better)

**Example**: 
- 100 queries total
- 85 queries have relevant results in top 5
- Hit Rate @ 5 = 85/100 = 0.85

### Creating Ground Truth Data

To evaluate your system, you need **ground truth** - known correct answers for test queries.

**Method 1: Manual Creation**
```python
ground_truth = [
    {
        "question": "How do I install Python?",
        "expected_doc_id": "python_installation_guide",
        "course": "data-engineering"
    },
    {
        "question": "What is a data pipeline?",
        "expected_doc_id": "pipeline_basics",
        "course": "data-engineering"
    }
    # ... more examples
]
```

**Method 2: LLM-Generated Questions**
```python
def generate_questions_for_document(doc_text, num_questions=5):
    """
    Use an LLM to generate questions that this document should answer
    """
    prompt = f"""
    Based on the following document, generate {num_questions} questions that this document would answer well. 
    Make the questions natural and varied - don't just copy words from the document.
    
    Document: {doc_text}
    
    Questions:
    """
    
    # Call your LLM here (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
    questions = call_llm(prompt)
    return questions

# Generate ground truth
ground_truth = []
for doc in documents:
    questions = generate_questions_for_document(doc['text'])
    for q in questions:
        ground_truth.append({
            "question": q,
            "expected_doc_id": doc['id'],
            "course": doc['course']
        })
```

### Evaluation Implementation

```python
def evaluate_search_system(search_function, ground_truth_data, top_k=5):
    """
    Evaluate a search system using MRR and Hit Rate
    """
    relevance_scores = []
    
    for item in ground_truth_data:
        query = item["question"]
        expected_id = item["expected_doc_id"]
        
        # Get search results
        results = search_function(query, top_k)
        
        # Check if expected document is in results
        relevance = []
        for i, result in enumerate(results):
            is_relevant = result["_source"]["id"] == expected_id
            relevance.append(is_relevant)
        
        relevance_scores.append(relevance)
    
    # Calculate metrics
    mrr = calculate_mrr(relevance_scores)
    hit_rate = calculate_hit_rate(relevance_scores)
    
    return {
        "MRR": mrr,
        "Hit_Rate": hit_rate,
        "num_queries": len(ground_truth_data)
    }

def calculate_mrr(relevance_scores):
    """Calculate Mean Reciprocal Rank"""
    total_reciprocal_rank = 0
    
    for relevance in relevance_scores:
        for i, is_relevant in enumerate(relevance):
            if is_relevant:
                total_reciprocal_rank += 1 / (i + 1)  # +1 because rank starts at 1
                break
    
    return total_reciprocal_rank / len(relevance_scores)

def calculate_hit_rate(relevance_scores):
    """Calculate Hit Rate (any relevant result in top K)"""
    hits = 0
    
    for relevance in relevance_scores:
        if any(relevance):  # If any result is relevant
            hits += 1
    
    return hits / len(relevance_scores)

# Example evaluation
results = evaluate_search_system(vector_search, ground_truth)
print(f"MRR: {results['MRR']:.3f}")
print(f"Hit Rate: {results['Hit_Rate']:.3f}")
```

### Comparing Different Approaches

```python
# Test different embedding models
models_to_test = [
    "all-mpnet-base-v2",
    "all-MiniLM-L6-v2", 
    "sentence-transformers/all-roberta-large-v1"
]

results = {}
for model_name in models_to_test:
    print(f"Testing {model_name}...")
    
    # Recreate index with new model
    model = SentenceTransformer(model_name)
    # ... reindex documents with new embeddings ...
    
    # Evaluate
    metrics = evaluate_search_system(vector_search, ground_truth)
    results[model_name] = metrics

# Compare results
for model, metrics in results.items():
    print(f"{model}: MRR={metrics['MRR']:.3f}, HR={metrics['Hit_Rate']:.3f}")
```

## Best Practices and Advanced Techniques

### 1. Choosing the Right Embedding Model

**Factors to Consider**:
- **Domain**: Use domain-specific models when available (bio, legal, etc.)
- **Language**: Multilingual models for non-English content
- **Performance**: Balance accuracy vs. speed/size requirements
- **Input Length**: Some models handle longer texts better

**Popular Models by Use Case**:
```python
# General purpose (good starting point)
"sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"  # 768 dim, high quality

# Fast and lightweight
"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"   # 384 dim, 5x faster

# Multilingual
"sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2"

# Code search
"microsoft/codebert-base"

# Long documents
"sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"  # handles up to 512 tokens well
```

### 2. Optimizing Vector Databases

**Index Configuration**:
```python
# FAISS optimization example
import faiss

# For CPU
index = faiss.IndexFlatIP(dimension)  # Inner product (fast exact search)

# For GPU (much faster)
res = faiss.StandardGpuResources()
index = faiss.index_cpu_to_gpu(res, 0, index)

# Approximate search for large datasets
index = faiss.IndexIVFFlat(quantizer, dimension, nlist)
index.train(training_vectors)
index.add(vectors)
index.nprobe = 10  # Search parameter
```

### 3. Handling Large Datasets

**Chunking Strategy**:
```python
def chunk_document(text, max_chunk_size=500, overlap=50):
    """
    Split long documents into overlapping chunks
    """
    words = text.split()
    chunks = []
    
    for i in range(0, len(words), max_chunk_size - overlap):
        chunk = ' '.join(words[i:i + max_chunk_size])
        chunks.append(chunk)
    
    return chunks

            processed_docs.append(chunk_doc)
    else:

**Batch Processing**:
```python
def process_embeddings_in_batches(texts, model, batch_size=32):
    """
    Process embeddings in batches to avoid memory issues
    """
    embeddings = []

        batch_embeddings = model.encode(batch)
        embeddings.extend(batch_embeddings)
    
    return embeddings
```

### 4. Query Enhancement

**Query Expansion**:
```python
def expand_query(original_query, expansion_terms=3):
    """
    Add related terms to improve search coverage
    """
    # Use word embeddings to find similar terms
    similar_words = find_similar_words(original_query, n=expansion_terms)
    expanded_query = original_query + " " + " ".join(similar_words)
    return expanded_query
```

**Multi-Vector Search**:
```python
def multi_vector_search(query, models, weights=None):
    """
    Combine results from multiple embedding models
    """
    if weights is None:
        weights = [1.0 / len(models)] * len(models)
    
    all_results = []
    for model, weight in zip(models, weights):
        results = vector_search_with_model(query, model)
        weighted_results = [(r, r['_score'] * weight) for r in results]
        all_results.extend(weighted_results)
    
    # Combine and re-rank
    combined_results = combine_and_rerank(all_results)
    return combined_results
```

### 5. Monitoring and Debugging

**Search Analytics**:
```python
def log_search_analytics(query, results, user_id=None):
    """
    Log search queries and results for analysis
    """
    analytics_data = {
        "timestamp": datetime.now(),
        "query": query,
        "user_id": user_id,
        "num_results": len(results),
        "top_score": results[0]['_score'] if results else 0,
        "result_ids": [r['_source']['id'] for r in results[:5]]
    }
    
    # Save to analytics database
    save_analytics(analytics_data)

def analyze_search_patterns():
    """
    Analyze common queries and failure patterns
    """
    # Common queries without good results
    low_score_queries = get_queries_with_low_scores()
    
    # Queries with no clicks
    no_click_queries = get_queries_without_clicks()
    
    return {
        "improvement_opportunities": low_score_queries,
        "potential_gaps": no_click_queries
    }
```

### 6. A/B Testing Search Systems

```python
def ab_test_search_systems(system_a, system_b, test_queries, metric="mrr"):
    """
    Compare two search systems
    """
    results_a = evaluate_search_system(system_a, test_queries)
    results_b = evaluate_search_system(system_b, test_queries)
    
    improvement = (results_b[metric] - results_a[metric]) / results_a[metric] * 100
    
    return {
        "system_a": results_a,
        "system_b": results_b,
        "improvement_percent": improvement,
        "winner": "B" if results_b[metric] > results_a[metric] else "A"
    }
```
